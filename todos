Todos for Snake-game:
- When the game is paused, add some visuals (like alpha effect).
- Add an autoincrease, where the player will enter new level every 5 points.
- Add an option that when a certain, special apple is eaten, the snake doesn't die when it hits the wall.
- For that special apple, show a timer for how long it will stay there.
- Options for special apples:
	- One that's very rare and increases the points by 10 (it shows up for like 5 seconds).
	- One that makes the snake increase and one to decrease the speed.
	- One to change the color of the snake.

Ideas:
- If the snake hits itself, it wouldn't die, just shrink (and maybe therefore loose points as well?).
- Increase speed 2x if player is holding ctrl + one of the arrow keys.
